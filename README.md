1. Introduction to TypeScript
Key Concepts:
    • What is TypeScript? TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds static types, which can help prevent errors at compile time rather than runtime.
    • Why use TypeScript? It offers better tooling for large-scale applications, early bug detection, and improved code structure with type annotations.
    • Setting Up TypeScript Environment You can install TypeScript globally with Node.js using:
      npm install -g typescript
      You can compile TypeScript files to JavaScript using the tsc command:
      tsc file.ts

Practice:
    • Install TypeScript.
    • Create a simple TypeScript file (file.ts) with a "Hello World" message and compile it.



    
2. Basic Types
Key Concepts:
    • Primitive Types: TypeScript offers built-in types like string, number, boolean.
   
    let isDone: boolean = false;
    let decimal: number = 6;
    let color: string = "blue";
   
    • Arrays and Tuples: Arrays can be defined with specific types:
    let list: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
   
    Tuples allow you to express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known:
    let x: [string, number];
    x = ["hello", 10];
   
    • Enums: Enums allow defining a set of named constants:
    enum Color { Red, Green, Blue }
    let c: Color = Color.Green;
    • Other Types: any, void, unknown, never.
        ◦ any: allows any type of value.
        ◦ unknown: safer than any, needs type checks before use.
        ◦ void: represents the absence of a value (used for functions that don’t return a value).
        ◦ never: represents unreachable code.
   
Practice:
    • Create variables of different types.
    • Try using arrays and tuples, and define an enum for weekdays.
